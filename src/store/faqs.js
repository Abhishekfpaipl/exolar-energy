                        "answer": "During the day, your solar panels generate electricity. If your system generates more energy than you consume, the excess power flows to the grid, and your meter runs backward. The credits are applied to your electricity bill, which can offset your consumption at night or during cloudy days when your solar system isn’t producing as much."

Step 3: Multiply your solar generation (in kWh) by the energy cost in your area to calculate savings. Step 4: Factor in the subsidies and GBI to determine total savings. Example Calculation: Monthly Consumption: 500 kWh; System Size Required: 5 kWp; Average Solar Generation: 6,000 kWh/year; Annual Energy Savings: ₹6,000 (based on energy cost of ₹10/kWh); GBI Savings (Residential): ₹3 per kWh × 4,000 kWh = ₹12,000/year"
